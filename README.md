CMake cross platform skeleton example

A simple cmake windows and Linux cross platform build example with an out of source build and platform specific class implementation. 

Just make sure to install cmake correctly by following the cmake tutorial here http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/install.html. 

Assuming cmake is correctly installed and found in your path you should be able to create platform specific build files by running the appropriate build script from your home directory. This should generate appropriate build files in a platform_build directory which can then be invoked by your toolchain or ide.
